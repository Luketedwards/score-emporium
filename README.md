2. Be able to filter scores based on a number of parameters.
3. Be able to purchase and view a library of my scores as both a PDF and interactive file.
4. View top performing scores through a review system.
5. Be able to request scores in a reddit style forum where the most popular posts rise to the top.

- As a Vendor I want to:

1. Be able to upload and sell my own scores.
2. Be able to view important sales data regarding income, growth, top performing products etc.
3. Customise my sales profile.
4. View trending score requests to help produce popular products.

## 1. Strategy
---
## Project purpose
- To provide a streamlined platform for musicians to both purchase and sell high quality interactive scores and PDF's
- To provide an interactive score player within the browser to improve the users learning experience.
- To provide a reddit style forum where users can make requests which vendors can then produce.

## 2. Scope
---
- I wanted a simple and intuitive user experience.
- I wanted all content to be displayed in a slick and aesthetic manner.
- I wanted a slick looking experience that functions well on a variety of screen sizes.
- I wanted a feature rich sales platform.
- I wanted a browser based interactive score system to play users uploaded or purchased scores.
- I wanted a comprehensive sales dashboard to provide sales metrics to users
- I wanted a reddit style voting system for users to request new scores. The most popular requests can then be voted to the top for vendors to produce.

## Deployment
---

### **Heroku**
  Before you can deploy your app to Heroku, initialize a local Git repository and commit your application code to it.

  #### **Create a Heroku Remote**
  Git remotes are versions of your repository that live on other servers. You deploy your app by pushing its code to a special Heroku-hosted remote that’s associated with your app.

  #### **For a New App**:

  The heroku create CLI command creates a new empty application on Heroku, along with an associated empty Git repository. If you run this command from your app’s root directory, the empty Heroku Git repository is automatically set as a remote for your local repository.

      heroku create -a harmonise

  You can use the "git remote -v" command to confirm that a remote named heroku has been set for your app.

  #### **For an Existing App**:

  Add a remote to your local repository with the heroku git:remote command. All you need is your Heroku app’s name:

      heroku git:remote -a harmonise

  #### **Deploy Your Code**:
  To deploy your app to Heroku, use the "git push" command to push the code from your local repository’s main branch to your heroku remote. For example:

      git push heroku main

  Use this same command whenever you want to deploy the latest committed version of your code to Heroku.

  Heroku only deploys code that you push to the master or main branches of the remote. Pushing code to another branch of the heroku remote has no effect.

  ### **Forking the GitHub Repository**
  By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.

  You can do this by completing the following steps:

  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
  2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

  ---

  ### **Making a Local Clone**:
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
  2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    $ git clone https://github.com/Luketedwards/harmonize.git
